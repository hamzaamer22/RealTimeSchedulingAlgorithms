# RealTimeSchedulingAlgorithms
Earliest Deadline First and Rate Monotonic algorithm implemented in python along with a graphical implementation of gantt chart using Tkinter library

# Project details
Rate Monotonic, and Earliest Deadline First algorithms are used for real time shceduling in the Operating Systems. The user has to pass the details about the execution time and time period of the processes, and the program will generate corresponding Gantt Chart. It will also tell whether the processes are schedulabale or not.


# How to run
* Open either of the algorithms on a suitable compiler/interpreter
* Edit configerations to run on the directory your copied file is placed in
* Run the program
* User will pass the number of processes, process deadline and execution time for each process
* You will see the complete result in the terminal
* A new tab will open up showing the graphical implementation of it (which however is limited to size due to tkinters limited screensize and as I havent implemented a scrollbar for this and those beyond that will only show the screen full till the defined size)
